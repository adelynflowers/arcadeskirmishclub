# 3D Printing Vendors

Arcade Skirmish Club events are 3d-print and proxy friendly. If you have a file you'd like to get printed, here are some local vendors who are willing to do that for you. Message them on discord for more details.

Generally you want miniatures printed in resin and terrain printed in FDM, but there are exceptions. Feel free to ask in discord if you need help deciding.
