## I'm new, where do I start?

If you're brand new to wargames, Skirmish-scale games are a great place to start. They have a lower cost of entry less models to paint, and often the models can be used in a full-sized army down the road. If you prefer sci-fi, [Click here for information about starting with Kill Team](./games/killteam.md). If you prefer fantasy, [Click here for information about starting with Warcry](./games/warcry.md)
