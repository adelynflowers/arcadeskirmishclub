# Warcry Matched League I

The Arcade Skirmish Club will be running a 6 week ladder league for Warcry Matched Play from January 5th to February 14th. 

An explanation of ladder leagues, as well as information on submitting match reports, can be found [here](../../resources/ladderleague.md).

Missions from the official Warcry matched play pack will be posted every week in the Warcry channel of the Xepher Arcade Discord. These missions **must** be used for the first game you play that week. Additional games can be played with other games from the Warcry Matched Play pack.

The matched play pack can be found on warhammer community, tenatively linked [here](https://assets.warhammer-community.com/eng_05-11_warcry_matched_play_battlepack-b83zcegpsg-e7zhpxwiut.pdf).

## Listbuilding

- **Warcrier is the source of truth for points values**, even when it differs from the official Warcry documents. 
- Bring a copy of your list for your opponent to look over
- Your Dagger, Shield, and Hammer are set in list-building before you see the battle plan. **Do not adjust your battle groups based on the mission.**
- You may switch lists between games
- Blessings are not currently integrated into warcrier, so be sure to manually annotate any blessings and their points values
