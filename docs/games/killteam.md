## New Players

### Where do I start?

If you're looking to try the game out, you don't need anything to start! Just let someone know you're interested and need to borrow a team, show up, and we'll have everything you need. Once you're ready to invest in the game, I recommend starting with your own kill team.

### Purchasing a Team

You can browse the available teams for Kill Team [on the warhammer store](https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/other-games/kill-team). You should always pick the team that you think looks the coolest. You're going to spend a lot of time building and painting these models, make sure you like them! Other than that, there's two considerations: One-box teams and Classification.

Many Kill Teams are "One-Box Teams". That means you buy one box and have every single option available to you. Some teams are two box teams or more. While this shouldn't be a hard stop for you, it's worth asking in discord if the team can still work without those extra boxes.

There's also the matter of *classification*. Games Workshop maintains a list of *Classified* teams on Warhammer Community. You can read more elsewhere, but the gist is that teams get 3-4 years from their release before they become *declassified*. Once declassified, the team cannot be played at official GW events and in many other tournament settings. **You will always be able to play declassified teams at Arcade Skirmish Club events**. I highly recommend ignoring classification for your first team. It is only a concern for players seeking to be highly competitive and travel to tournaments. If/When you get to that point, you'll know what you're looking for.
