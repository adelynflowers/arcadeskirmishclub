# Warhammer: Age of Sigmar

## Schedule

Age of Sigmar play is scheduled for every other Wednesday in 2026 (on warhammer paint nights). These nights are currently reserved for the 2026 escalation league, but will be available for pick up games in the future. For more details on the escalation league, [click here](../events/2026-escalation-league.md).

## Pick-up Games

Pick-up games can be scheduled ad-hoc as desired. Check with staff in #warhammer-general to see if tables will be available before you head out. The store currently has one full size mat and two tables worth of terrain, with 40mm+3" objective markers.
